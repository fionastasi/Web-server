# Web-server

This project implements a Python-based web server that ensures compatibility with Python 3.7 and above. It features a version check to enforce this requirement and uses import redirection to handle module imports effectively. The script is designed to run the pip module as the main module, making use of modern Python features while maintaining compatibility with Python 2 syntax.
